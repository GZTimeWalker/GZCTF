IMPORTANT:

This Restricted License applies ONLY to the Restricted Components
(defined below). All other parts of the repository remain licensed
under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3) unless
explicitly stated otherwise.

This license MUST NOT be interpreted to impose additional restrictions
on AGPLv3-licensed source code in this repository.

0. ACCEPTANCE

   By downloading, copying, installing, deploying, executing, offering a
   network service that incorporates, or redistributing any Restricted
   Components (as defined below), you accept and agree to be bound by
   this License. If you do not agree, you must not use or redistribute
   the Restricted Components.

1. DEFINITIONS

   1.1 "Restricted Components" mean the source files and/or compiled
      artifacts located at (the "Initial Restricted Set") effective as of
      the Version date of this License:

        - src/GZCTF/Services/Container/Manager/*
        - src/GZCTF/ClientApp/src/hooks/useConfig.ts
        - src/GZCTF/ClientApp/src/components/Copyright.tsx

      plus any future file explicitly designated in PROPRIETARY_COMPONENTS.md
      as "Restricted" (each an "Added Restricted File").

      An Added Restricted File becomes a Restricted Component upon the
      git commit that first adds the designation "Restricted" for that
      file to PROPRIETARY_COMPONENTS.md (the "Designation Commit").

      Copies acquired by a Licensee before the Designation Commit are not
      retroactively restricted (but later updates incorporating the
      Added Restricted File are). The Initial Restricted Set is effective
      as of this License Version date.

   1.1.1 (Permitted Non-Substantive Changes) For clarity, purely
      mechanical or packaging changes that do not alter logic or
      semantics are NOT treated as a Modification (defined in Section 3)
      and remain "unmodified" for purposes of Section 2. Examples:

      (a) line-ending normalization;
      (b) file renaming or relocation;
      (c) build system wrapping (e.g., bundler wrappers, source maps);
      (d) minification / compression without semantic alteration;
      (e) cryptographic signing;
      (f) injection of runtime configuration values (environment variables,
          *.env) without changing code branches;
      (g) removal of comments ONLY when required by an automated minifier
         and not altering code tokens.

   1.1.2 (Prohibited Without Separate Authorization) Any change beyond
      the Permitted Non-Substantive Changes is a Modification.

   1.2 "Licensee" means the individual or legal entity exercising
      rights under this License.

   1.3 "Licensor" means the original author and copyright holder of
      the GZ::CTF project.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

   Subject to the conditions of this License, Licensor grants Licensee a
   worldwide, royalty-free (unless otherwise agreed in writing),
   non-exclusive, perpetual license to:

      (a) Use, reproduce, and install the Restricted Components for any
         purpose, including for commercial purposes and for providing
         publicly accessible services.
      (b) Distribute the unmodified Restricted Components to third
         parties ("Redistribution") provided the conditions in Section 2.3
         are satisfied.

   2.3 Redistribution Conditions (Must Accompany Content). Any
      redistribution (including internal corporate redistribution) of
      unmodified Restricted Components MUST:

      (a) Provide the Restricted Components in verbatim form (only
         Permitted Non-Substantive Changes allowed).
      (b) Include a complete, unaltered copy of this License text.
      (c) Retain all copyright, trademark, attribution, and any
         proprietary notices (including headers) intact and legible.
      (d) Clearly identify the upstream project and provide a URL to the
         official repository or website.
      (e) Not impose additional terms that purport to restrict recipients
         from exercising the rights granted by this License with respect
         to the unmodified Restricted Components.
      (f) Provide, upon any network provision of functionality that
         relies on the Restricted Components, a reasonable method for
         end users to obtain: (i) the unmodified Restricted Components
         actually deployed (or a commit hash referencing them), (ii) this
         License, and (iii) notices required by AGPLv3 for AGPL-covered
         parts of the combined service.

   2.4 No Sublicensing of Different Terms. You may NOT grant downstream
      recipients additional or alternative license terms for the
      Restricted Components. You may, however, distribute them as part
      of a larger work where other parts carry their own licenses, so
      long as (i) this License governs the Restricted Components; and
      (ii) you do not misrepresent their licensing.

   These rights are granted ONLY for the unmodified Restricted Components.
   See Section 3 for restrictions regarding modification.

3. RESTRICTIONS ON MODIFICATION

   The rights granted in Section 2 apply ONLY to the Restricted Components
   in their original, unmodified form as provided by the Licensor.

   Any modification, adaptation, translation, creation of derivative works,
   deletion, decompilation (except to the limited extent unavoidable under
   applicable law for interoperability), disassembly, or reverse
   engineering of the Restricted Components ("Modification") is a
   material breach of this License. The rights granted in Section 2 do
   not extend to any Modified version of the Restricted Components.

   3.1 Security Patch Exception. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you MAY
      apply and temporarily run a Minimal Security Patch to address a
      bona fide, documented security vulnerability (CVSS 7.0+ or
      materially exploitable) solely to protect systems you operate,
      provided that:

      (a) The patch is the least intrusive change reasonably necessary.
      (b) You notify Licensor (security disclosure to the contact in
         Section 15) within 7 days of deployment, supplying a diff.
      (c) You do not redistribute the patched version (other than making
         it available for network use to your own end users) unless and
         until the Licensor publishes an official update or grants
         written authorization.
      (d) You remove or replace the patch with an official upstream
         release within 30 days of such release (or agreed extension).
      (e) Failure to meet any of (a)-(d) converts the patch into an
         unauthorized Modification.

      A "Minimal Security Patch" is a change whose primary effect is to
      remediate the vulnerability and that does not add features or alter
      functional behavior beyond what is strictly required.

   To obtain the right to create or use a Modified version of the
   Restricted Components, you must secure a separate, explicit written
   agreement from the Licensor. Without such an agreement, you SHALL NOT:

     (a) Create a Modification of the Restricted Components.
     (b) Use, reproduce, distribute, or sublicense any Modified version
         of the Restricted Components.
     (c) Remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices, trademarks, or
         attribution in the Restricted Components. This restriction applies
         even to unmodified versions.

4. SEPARATION FROM AGPL CODE / NETWORK SOURCE AVAILABILITY

   4.1 The Restricted Components are NOT provided under AGPLv3. No rights in
      them are granted by the AGPL license file in the repository.

   4.2 Modifications to AGPL-licensed portions of the codebase are governed
      exclusively by AGPLv3. This Restricted License does not add conditions
      to AGPL-covered files.

   4.3 Aggregation or dynamic linking between AGPL portions and Restricted
     Components does not relicense either part.

   4.4 Network Availability Alignment. If you provide the Restricted
      Components as part of a network service together with AGPLv3
      components, you must satisfy AGPLv3's network source requirements
      for the AGPL-covered portions AND make available to remote users a
      method (e.g., prominently linked page) to obtain the exact
      unmodified Restricted Components you are deploying (or a cryptographic
      hash / commit reference plus retrieval instructions) along with this
      License. This Section 4.4 is an affirmative condition of the grant
      in Section 2 and does not itself relicense the Restricted Components
      under AGPLv3.

   4.5 No Additional Restrictions on AGPL Code. Nothing in this License
      may be construed to impose any further restriction on AGPLv3
      licensed files. If a conflict appears to arise, the AGPLv3 terms
      control for AGPL-covered code.

5. EVALUATION / TRIAL (Optional â€“ if granted)

   Licensor may, at its sole discretion, grant a time-limited, non-renewable
   evaluation right for *modified* versions of the Restricted Components.
   Unless converted to a paid authorization, all such evaluation rights
   terminate automatically at the end of the stated period.

6. OWNERSHIP

   The Restricted Components are licensed, not sold. Licensor retains all
   intellectual property, moral, and neighboring rights. No implied licenses.

7. COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION

   Upon reasonable suspicion that the Restricted Components have been
   modified in breach of Section 3, Licensor may request that Licensee
   provide, in good faith, sufficient information (e.g., cryptographic
   hashes, build logs, diffs) to verify compliance. Such information shall
   be limited strictly to what is necessary to confirm that the Restricted
   Components (excluding Permitted Non-Substantive Changes or a permitted
   Security Patch) remain unmodified. Requests must: (a) be in writing;
   (b) briefly state the grounds for suspicion; and (c) allow at least 14
   days for a response unless exigent risk of active exploitation is shown.
   Failure to reasonably cooperate (while not withholding legally
   protected confidential or trade secret information beyond what is
   strictly required) may be considered a material breach of this License.

8. TERMINATION

   This License terminates automatically if Licensee breaches Section 3
   and fails to cure such breach within 15 days of written notice from
   Licensor (email sufficient). Deliberate concealment of a breach waives
   the cure period.

   Upon termination, Licensee must cease all use of, and destroy all
   copies of, any *modified* Restricted Components. Rights to use the
   original, unmodified Restricted Components obtained prior to breach
   remain unaffected unless termination is due to willful infringement or
   fraudulent misrepresentation.

   Termination of this Restricted License does not terminate Licensee's
   rights under AGPLv3 for AGPL-covered code.

9. TRADEMARKS

   "GZ::CTF" and related names/logos are trademarks of Licensor.
   No trademark rights are granted except for truthful, non-misleading
   descriptive references.

   Any implied endorsement is prohibited.

10. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

   TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE RESTRICTED COMPONENTS
   ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
   FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ACCURACY.

11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
   OR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, EVEN IF ADVISED
   OF THE POSSIBILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
   LICENSOR'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
   THE RESTRICTED COMPONENTS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) ANY
   MANDATORY MINIMUM AMOUNT THAT APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES (IF SUCH LAW
   PROHIBITS COMPLETE EXCLUSION); OR (B) ZERO (0) WHERE LAW PERMITS TOTAL
   EXCLUSION AND NO FEES HAVE BEEN PAID. IF FEES WERE PAID UNDER A SEPARATE
   WRITTEN AGREEMENT, LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID
   FOR THE MOST RECENT 12-MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE FIRST EVENT GIVING
   RISE TO LIABILITY, SUBJECT ALWAYS TO ANY NON-DISCLAIMABLE STATUTORY
   MINIMUM.

12. EXPORT / COMPLIANCE

   Licensee shall comply with all applicable export control and
   sanctions laws with respect to the Restricted Components.

13. GOVERNING LAW / VENUE

   Unless otherwise specified in a separate Restricted Agreement,
   disputes shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of
   Licensor's principal place of business, excluding conflict of
   law rules. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
   International Sale of Goods does not apply.

14. MISCELLANEOUS

   14.1 No waiver of any breach is a waiver of subsequent breaches.

   14.2 If any provision is held unenforceable, the remainder remains
      in effect and the provision will be replaced with an enforceable
      one closest to its intent.

   14.3 This License, together with any separate written agreement executed
      between Licensor and Licensee for the modification of Restricted
      Components, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties.

   14.4 Severability for Jurisdictions with Mandatory Consumer / Statutory
      Rights. Nothing in this License excludes or limits any right that
      cannot be excluded under applicable law; affected clauses shall be
      construed to the minimum extent necessary to comply.

   14.5 No Implied Patent License. No patent rights are granted or implied
      by this License. Any patent license must be expressly set forth in a
      separate written agreement.

   14.6 Reservation of Rights. All rights not expressly granted are
      reserved by Licensor.

   14.7 Language. In case of translation, the English text of this Version
      governs.
