"GZCTF" and "GZ::CTF" (the "Marks") together with associated logos, banners, and distinctive brand assets are trademarks or service marks of the project author ("Licensor").

This repository contains software released under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3) except for components explicitly identified as Restricted Components under the Restricted License (Identifier: LicenseRef-GZCTF-Restricted). The AGPLv3 does NOT grant blanket trademark rights.

### 1. Permitted Without Separate Permission

You may (provided you do not mislead users):

1. Make truthful, descriptive references: "Powered by GZCTF", "Forked from GZCTF".
2. Use the name in academic or comparative discussion.
3. Include unmodified screenshots of the UI in documentation or reviews.

### 2. Requires Prior Written Permission

1. Using the Marks (or confusingly similar variants) in a product, fork, distribution, or service name implying official origin.
2. Using logos or banners in marketing, sales decks, press releases, or paid advertising.
3. Registering domains or social media handles that could cause confusion (e.g. official-gzctf.example).

### 3. Prohibited Uses

1. Any use implying endorsement, certification, support, or partnership without permission.
2. Altering the logo to create derivative marks that could cause confusion.
3. Using the Marks in, or in connection with, illegal, defamatory, or unethical material.

### 4. Attribution Guidance

If you operate a public instance or derivative:

```
This service is based on the open core of GZCTF (AGPLv3) â€“ GZCTF is a trademark of its respective owner. No endorsement implied.
```

### 5. Logo Assets

Official logo / banner image files (such as `assets/` and more) are (unless otherwise indicated) NOT covered by AGPLv3 and may be subject to additional terms (All Rights Reserved). Do not redistribute modified versions without permission.

### 6. Enforcement

Licensor may request modification or discontinuation of any non-compliant use. Continued non-compliance may result in legal action under trademark or unfair competition laws.

### 7. No Additional Code Restrictions

This policy does not add restrictions to AGPLv3-licensed source code; it governs brand usage only.
