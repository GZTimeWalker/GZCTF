# Dynamic Flag

GZCTF comes with built-in support for dynamic flag distribution, which will be injected using the `GZCTF_FLAG` environment variable when the container is started.

<Callout type="info">

The main reason for using this environment variable is to prevent commercial abuse of GZCTF, so customizing this feature will not be available in the short term.

</Callout>

## Configure Dynamic Flag

In dynamic challenge's flag and attachment management page, the flag template will be used to generate dynamic flag with the following rules:

1. Leave it blank to generate a random `GUID` as the flag
2. If `[GUID]` placeholder is specified, only this placeholder will be replaced with a random GUID.
3. If `[TEAM_HASH]` placeholder is specified, it will be replaced with the hash value generated from the team token and related information.
4. If `[TEAM_HASH]` placeholder is not specified, Leet string functionality will be enabled, and the string inside the curly braces will be transformed based on the template. Make sure that the entropy of the flag template string is high enough.
5. If you want to enable Leet string functionality when specifying `[TEAM_HASH]`, add the `[LEET]` marker before the flag template string. In this case, the entropy of the flag template string will not be checked.
6. If you want to enable special characters when using Leet string (which may cause injection issues), add the `[CLEET]` marker before the flag template string.

## Examples

1. Leave it blank to generate `flag{1bab71b8-117f-4dea-a047-340b72101d7b}`
2. Set the flag to `MyCTF{[GUID]}` can get `MyCTF{1bab71b8-117f-4dea-a047-340b72101d7b}`
3. Set the flag to `flag{hello world}` will generate flag with Leet and get `flag{He1lo_w0r1d}`
4. Set the flag to `[CLEET]flag{hello sara}` will generate flag with special characters like `flag{He1!o_$@rA}`
5. Set the flag to `flag{hello_world_[TEAM_HASH]}` will generate flag with team hash like `flag{hello_world_5418ce4d815c}`
6. Enable Leet with team hash as the same time with `[LEET]flag{hello world [TEAM_HASH]}` can generate `flag{He1lo_w0r1d_5418ce4d815c}`

## Leet String

Leet String is a method of replacing characters in a string with numbers or symbols. For example, replacing `a` with `4`, `e` with `3`, and so on. GZCTF follows the following Leet String rules:

| Characters | Replaced with | Characters | Replaced with | Characters | Replaced with | Characters | Replaced with |
| :--------: | :------------ | :--------: | :------------ | :--------: | :------------ | :--------: | :------------ |
|    `A`     | `Aa4`         |    `B`     | `Bb68`        |    `C`     | `Cc`          |    `D`     | `Dd`          |
|    `E`     | `Ee3`         |    `F`     | `Ff1`         |    `G`     | `Gg69`        |    `H`     | `Hh`          |
|    `I`     | `Ii1l`        |    `J`     | `Jj`          |    `K`     | `Kk`          |    `L`     | `Ll1I`        |
|    `M`     | `Mm`          |    `N`     | `Nn`          |    `O`     | `Oo0`         |    `P`     | `Pp`          |
|    `Q`     | `Qq9`         |    `R`     | `Rr`          |    `S`     | `Ss5`         |    `T`     | `Tt7`         |
|    `U`     | `Uu`          |    `V`     | `Vv`          |    `W`     | `Ww`          |    `X`     | `Xx`          |
|    `Y`     | `Yy`          |    `Z`     | `Zz2`         |    `0`     | `0oO`         |    `1`     | `1lI`         |
|    `2`     | `2zZ`         |    `3`     | `3eE`         |    `4`     | `4aA`         |    `5`     | `5Ss`         |
|    `6`     | `6Gb`         |    `7`     | `7T`          |    `8`     | `8bB`         |    `9`     | `9g`          |

When enabling complex Leet strings, please pay attention to character injection issues. It follows the rules below, as there are more possibilities, the length required to reach the specified entropy will be shorter:

| Characters | Replaced with | Characters | Replaced with | Characters | Replaced with | Characters | Replaced with |
| :--------: | :------------ | :--------: | :------------ | :--------: | :------------ | :--------: | :------------ | --- |
|    `A`     | `Aa4@`        |    `B`     | `Bb68`        |    `C`     | `Cc(`         |    `D`     | `Dd`          |
|    `E`     | `Ee3`         |    `F`     | `Ff1`         |    `G`     | `Gg69`        |    `H`     | `Hh`          |
|    `I`     | `Ii1l!`       |    `J`     | `Jj`          |    `K`     | `Kk`          |    `L`     | `Ll1I!`       |
|    `M`     | `Mm`          |    `N`     | `Nn`          |    `O`     | `Oo0#`        |    `P`     | `Pp`          |
|    `Q`     | `Qq9`         |    `R`     | `Rr`          |    `S`     | `Ss5$`        |    `T`     | `Tt7`         |
|    `U`     | `Uu`          |    `V`     | `Vv`          |    `W`     | `Ww`          |    `X`     | `Xx`          |
|    `Y`     | `Yy`          |    `Z`     | `Zz2?`        |    `0`     | `0oO#`        |    `1`     | `1lI          | `   |
|    `2`     | `2zZ?`        |    `3`     | `3eE`         |    `4`     | `4aA`         |    `5`     | `5Ss`         |
|    `6`     | `6Gb`         |    `7`     | `7T`          |    `8`     | `8B&`         |    `9`     | `9g`          |

### Security

The security level of Leet String depends on the entropy of the flag template string. For each character in the flag template, it can be replaced with multiple characters. We calculate the entropy of the Leet String by taking the logarithm base 2 of the length of the variable character set for each variable character and summing them up.

$$
\begin{aligned}
H &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log_2{m_i} \\
m_i &= \begin{cases}
    \text{len}(\text{LeetMap}[c_i]) & \text{if } c_i \text{ is in LeetMap} \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

In GZCTF, this metric is restricted to be no less than 32, otherwise it will result in a decrease in the security of the flag.

## Team Hash

Team hash is a method of hashing the team token with related information. It will be used for generating dynamic flags to ensure that each team has a unique flag.

In GZCTF, the team hash is the middle 12 characters of the SHA256 hash, for example `5418ce4d815c`. It will be used to replace the `[TEAM_HASH]` placeholder in the flag template.

The calculation of the team hash involves three parameters:

- Team Token: A system-generated and signed ed25519 signature issued during team registration, which can be verified with a public key.
- Challenge ID: The unique identifier of the challenge.
- Game Hash Salt: The SHA256 hash of the encrypted competition signing private key after adding salt.

The Python code for generating the Team Hash is as follows:

```python
from hashlib import sha256

str_sha256 = lambda s: sha256(s.encode()).hexdigest()

encrypted_game_pk = "...some base64..."
chal_id = 114
team_token = "114:...some base64..."

# you can get this salt from /api/edit/games/{id}/teamhashsalt
game_salt = str_sha256(f"GZCTF@{encrypted_game_pk}@PK")

# you should calculate this hash by yourself, and put it in challenge
chal_salt = str_sha256(f"{game_salt}::{chal_id}")

# let your challenge to calculate team hash
team_hash = str_sha256(f"{chal_salt}::{team_token}")[12:24]
```

The game hash salt `game_salt` can be obtained by accessing the `/api/edit/games/{id}/hashsalt` endpoint with administrator privileges. If you need to use it, please ensure its confidentiality.

### Security

- Team Token is issued by GZCTF, it is an ed25519 signature, **can be verified with a public key, so it will not be forged**
- Game hash salt is a game-specific value, derived from the hash of the game signing private key, **the administrator needs to ensure its security**
- Challenge ID is an integer, generated by the system when creating a challenge, **the administrator combines the game hash salt to calculate the challenge hash salt**
- Challenge hash salt is a challenge-specific value, should be used for the final Team Hash calculation, **its leakage will not affect the security of other challenges**

### How to use Team Hash properly

One main use case of team hash is for external challenges (challenges where the final container accessed by the players which is not instanced by GZCTF). For example, in cases where deploying and managing complicate web challenges is difficult and complex, there might be only one external instance of the challenge instead of a separate instance for each team.
In this case, we can verify the team token and generate a dynamic flag based on the team token, ensuring that each team has a unique dynamic flag.

### Team Signature Verification

The competition public key can be obtained directly from the competition management page. It is an ed25519 public key encoded in Base64, for example:

```
s2r5WQUClYNsldJrRKanrKivBUtyN+3MjeOiKNL3znI=
```

The team token is an ed25519 signature encoded in Base64. Its format is:

```
1201:HCdjp352NcQoL/4gS8RP3xRt5B9xX2V4m2UeoqfM2dxcLrI5FiYQ7HC9pqreG+tudWjYJf0atzQhhAKyYDKsCg==
```

You can use the following code to verify the team token, where `base64` and `nacl` are Python libraries:

```python
from base64 import b64decode
from nacl.signing import VerifyKey

token = "1201:HCdjp352NcQoL/4gS8RP3xRt5B9xX2V4m2UeoqfM2dxcLrI5FiYQ7HC9pqreG+tudWjYJf0atzQhhAKyYDKsCg=="
verify_key = VerifyKey(b64decode("s2r5WQUClYNsldJrRKanrKivBUtyN+3MjeOiKNL3znI="))

data = f"GZCTF_TEAM_{token.split(':')[0]}".encode()

try:
    verify_key.verify(data, b64decode(token.split(':')[1]))
except:
    print("Invalid token")
```

PyNaCl is a Python wrapper for libsodium, which is likely pre-installed on common systems. For more details, refer to: [PyNaCl](https://pynacl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

You can also use any other language's ed25519 signature verification library to verify if the team token is a valid signature issued by the platform and provide cryptographic assurance for the security of flag distribution.
