# Port Range Configuration

The following methods are common practices and may vary depending on the system environment. If they do not work as expected, please refer to relevant documentation and troubleshooting solutions.

## Docker Deployment

- `sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf`
- Add the following content to specify `ip_local_port_range`:

```
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 20000 50000
```

- Run `sudo sysctl -p` to apply the changes
- Restart Docker service

## K3s Deployment

- `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/k3s.service`
- Edit the `ExecStart` in the following settings to specify `service-node-port-range`

```
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/k3s \
    server \
    --kube-apiserver-arg service-node-port-range=20000-50000
```

- `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
- `sudo systemctl restart k3s`

## K8s Deployment

The default range is `30000-32767`. If adjustments are needed, please refer to the following:

- Run `sudo vim /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml`.
- Add `--service-node-port-range=<new-range>` in `spec.containers.command`.
- For example, `--service-node-port-range=30000-40000`.
- If there are multiple master nodes, please ensure that all master nodes are modified.
- If deployed as a binary, modify the `kube-apiserver` configuration file, use the same parameters as above, and restart the service.

## Docker Swarm Deployment:

We have not tried it yet. If anyone has succeeded, please feel free to submit a PR to add it.
