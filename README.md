## Features üõ†Ô∏è

- Create highly customizable challenges

  - Type of challenges: Static Attachment, Dynamic Attachment, Static Container, Dynamic Container
    - Static Attachment: Shared attachments, any configured flag can be accepted.
    - Dynamic Attachment: The number of flags and attachments must be at least the number of teams. Attachments and flags are distributed according to the teams.
    - Static Container: Shared container templates, no dynamic flag is issued, and any configured flag can be submitted.
    - Dynamic Container: Automatically generate and issue flags through container environment variables, and flag of each team is unique.

  - Dynamic Scores

    - Curve of scores:

      $$f(S, r, d, x) = \left \lfloor S \times \left[r  + ( 1- r) \times \exp\left( \dfrac{1 - x}{d} \right) \right] \right \rfloor $$

      Where $S$ is the original score, $r$ is the minimum score ratio, $d$ is the difficulty coefficient, and $x$ is the number of submissions. The first three parameters can be customized to satisfy most of the dynamic score requirements.

    - Bonus for first three solves:
      The platform rewards 5%, 3%, and 1% of the current score for the first three solves respectively.
