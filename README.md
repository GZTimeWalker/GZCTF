GZ::CTF is an open source CTF platform based on ASP.NET Core.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **To save your effort, please read the documentation carefully before using: [https://docs.ctf.gzti.me/en](https://docs.ctf.gzti.me/en)**

> [!WARNING]
>
> **Upgrade and migration considerations:**
>
> 1. To upgrade the platform, simply pull the latest image and restart, and the database migration will be performed automatically.
> 2. In general, **downgrade** operations are not supported. Upgrading versions with a large time span may result in data incompatibility, so **please make sure to back up your data**.
> 3. After the upgrade, there may be new configuration items and changes in file structure. It is recommended to consult the official documentation or the community.
> 4. If you are migrating to another branch project, please pay attention to whether the database structure has changed. **The database after the change does not support rollback to the original version**.
> 5. The community and the official maintainers are not responsible for data loss, data incompatibility, and other issues. For issues with branch projects, please contact the corresponding project maintainer.

## Features üõ†Ô∏è

- Create highly customizable challenges

  - Type of challenges: Static Attachment, Dynamic Attachment, Static Container, Dynamic Container

    - Static Attachment: Shared attachments, any configured flag can be accepted.
    - Dynamic Attachment: The number of flags and attachments must be at least the number of teams. Attachments and flags are distributed according to the teams.
    - Static Container: Shared container templates, no dynamic flag is issued, and any configured flag can be submitted.
    - Dynamic Container: Automatically generate and issue flags through container environment variables, and flag of each team is unique.

  - Dynamic Scores

    - Curve of scores:

      $$f(S, r, d, x) = \left \lfloor S \times \left[r  + ( 1- r) \times \exp\left( \dfrac{1 - x}{d} \right) \right] \right \rfloor $$

      Where $S$ is the original score, $r$ is the minimum score ratio, $d$ is the difficulty coefficient, and $x$ is the number of submissions. The first three parameters can be customized to satisfy most of the dynamic score requirements.

    - Bonus for first three solves:
      The platform rewards 5%, 3%, and 1% of the current score for the first three solves respectively.

  - Disable or enable challenges during the competition, and release new challenges at any time.
  - Dynamic flag sharing detection, optional flag template, leet flag
