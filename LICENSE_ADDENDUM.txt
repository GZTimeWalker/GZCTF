License Addendum (Clarification of Dual Licensing & Trademarks)
Updated: 2025-09-11

1. Scope
	This Addendum clarifies the coexistence of (a) AGPLv3-licensed core code
	and (b) separately licensed Restricted Components and trademarks. It does
	NOT impose additional restrictions on any file already under AGPLv3;
	instead it identifies material that is NOT covered by AGPLv3.

2. AGPLv3 Core
	Except where explicitly designated below as "Restricted Components", the
	source code in this repository is licensed under the GNU Affero General
	Public License v3.0 (see LICENSE.txt).

3. Restricted Components (Restricted License ONLY)
	The following paths are excluded from AGPLv3 coverage and are provided
	(if distributed) solely under the GZCTF Restricted License
    (Identifier: LicenseRef-GZCTF-Restricted):

	  - src/GZCTF/Services/Container/Manager/*
	  - src/GZCTF/ClientApp/src/hooks/useConfig.ts
      - src/GZCTF/ClientApp/src/components/Copyright.tsx

	Use and redistribution of these components are governed by the terms
	of the GZCTF Restricted License. Any modification, deletion, or derivative
	creation of these Restricted Components requires a separate written
	authorization or commercial agreement. Absent such authorization, you
	have NO rights to modify or delete these components.

4. Trademarks / Protected Identifiers
	"GZCTF" / "GZ::CTF" names, flags, tokens, and associated logos are
	trademarks or identifiers of the project author. Their usage is governed
	by TRADEMARKS.md. Descriptive, truthful references (e.g. "Forked from
	GZCTF") are permitted. Misuse implying endorsement or official status is
	prohibited.

5. Separation Principle
	This Addendum must not be read to curtail any AGPLv3 right for
	non-restricted files. If any clause appears to conflict with AGPLv3 as
	applied to AGPL-covered code, AGPLv3 prevails for that code.

6. Custom License Identifier
	The restricted license text is stored at:

      - licenses/LicenseRef-GZCTF-Restricted.txt

	SPDX Custom Identifier: LicenseRef-GZCTF-Restricted

7. Contact
	Restricted & licensing inquiries: Time.GZ@outlook.com

8. Attribution Example
	"This deployment includes the open core of GZCTF (AGPLv3). Certain
	functionality uses proprietary GZCTF Restricted Components under a
	commercial license."

9. Revision History
	2024-08-10: Initial Addendum (superseded)
	2025-09-11: Converted to dual-licensing clarification; introduced explicit
	separation & SPDX custom identifier.
